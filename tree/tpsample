Here are some examples to illustrate the tpar program and the
`T' triangle, `L' lexical, `O' omit, `M' mother, `D' daughter,
and `P' phantom tree commands.

%%  For tty output, use
%% 	% tpar tpsample |tree |more
%% or	% tpar -t tpsample |tree |more
%% For TeX output, use
%% 	% tpar -t tpsample |tree -t >tpsample.tex
%% or	% tpar -t tpsample |tree -u >tpsample.tex

This is from the man page:

 (ex8)	\tree \T S
		     every
		     good boy
                     VP
			\L V - does
			\L A - fine

A couple of examples from McCawley's text:

p. 35
(6)\tree -b2
S[0]
    S[1]
	S[2]
	    NP\T - the terrorists
	    VP
		V\L - shoot
		NP\T - the hostage
	n't
    Adv\L - probably

The V' with `say' in this next example came out too wide, originally,
because the two constituents following the V, the P' and NP, couldn't be
put close enough together.  I wanted to lower the S[2] under the NP so
it would go closer to the preceding P', so I've put a node with no name
but with command Z between the NP and the S[2] below it.  The
Z command does not do anything except hold a place in the tree;
it's a little tricky.

p. 689
(8)\tree
S[0]
  NP[x]
    the
    S[3]
      NP - you
      V'\T - send $x$ many Christmas\L - cards to your friends
  S[1]
    NP - it
    V'
      V\L - say
      P'\T - in the Times Al.
      NP
       \Z
        S[2]
	  NP\T - President R
	  V'\T
	    send more than\L - $x$ Christmas cards to\L - Republican supporters


In this example from McCawley, p. 310, the V is made an unnatural
mother of the Adv with the M and D commands, and the line that
would have connected the Adv to the S is omitted with the O command.
The original position of the Adv is marked with a phantom, to get the
tree to look like something belongs here.

(6b) \tree
V'
  \M V
    V\L - prove
    ghost\P
  NP
    S\T - that the earth is round
  \D\O Adv\L - conclusively

From McCawley, p. 423.  There are two side-by-side trees here, but
the left one has omitted lines, so that all that is visible is
`RNR' and the arrow.  The N-bar is connected to the S `who teach ...'
with M and D commands, but the line connecting the S to its natural
mother remains.  To get the line connecting the two N-bars to slant
to the left, the P command is used to put a phantom constituent in
the original position of the RNR'd S.  That first Z command is there
just to hold a place in the tree.
