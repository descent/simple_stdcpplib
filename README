This is a very simple c++ standard library for "bare-metal".

support soc:
* stm32f4discovery
* p103 qemu
* rpi2

mymain.cpp is a example for testing.

feature:
* c runtime
* c++ runtime
* global object ctor/dtor
* exception handle (implement by setjmp/longjmp)
* printf
* malloc/free
* new/delete
* vector
* string
* map
* list

you can use p103 qemu to run it
(https://github.com/beckus/qemu_stm32.git)

compile:
  make # default is p103
  ./p103.sh # script example for p103 qemu

x86/16bit mode:
x86/start.s bios_print_char
should use retl, let sp +4, not +2
save ebx/eax register, 

fixed
char cc='A';
cout << ": " << cc << endl;
the error.

narrowing heap size, because the execute can access 64k address.
